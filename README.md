# Movie-Recommendatio-System
This is a machine learning project that implements a movie recommender system based on the TMDB dataset from Kaggle. T
he system utilizes content based filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset, which can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv). 
It consists of movie metadata such as title, genre, cast, crew, and user ratings.

# Project Structure
• Movierecommendersystem.ipynb:-This file contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. 
• app.py:- This file contains the source code for the movie recommender system. 
• requirements.txt: This file lists the Python libraries and their versions required to run the project.

# Installation
1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/madhu1113/Movie-Recommendatio-System.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd Movie-Recommendation-System
3. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usages
Run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the recommender system, and evaluate its performance.
Modify the configuration parameters to customize the behavior of the recommender system, such as the number of recommendations to generate and the similarity metric to use.
Use the recommender system API to integrate the movie recommendations into your own applications.

# Here are some potential areas for future improvements:
• Implementing more advanced collaborative filtering techniques, such as matrix factorization or deep learning-based models.
• Incorporating additional features or external datasets to enhance the recommendation quality.
• Developing a user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
